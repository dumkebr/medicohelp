# MÃ©dicoHelp - AI Medical Assistant

## Overview
MÃ©dicoHelp is a professional AI-powered medical platform designed for healthcare professionals. It offers AI medical consultations with conversation history, automatic analysis of medical images, a comprehensive patient registration and management system, and direct integration with Memed for digital prescriptions. The project aims to streamline diagnostic and administrative workflows, enhancing efficiency and accuracy for medical professionals.

## User Preferences
I prefer simple language and clear explanations. I want iterative development with frequent updates and feedback. Ask before making major changes or architectural decisions. Do not make changes to the folder `Z` or the file `Y`.

## System Architecture

MÃ©dicoHelp utilizes a modern full-stack JavaScript architecture, prioritizing a professional UI/UX and robust backend.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
-   **Frameworks**: React with Wouter for routing, Shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for design.
-   **Theming**: Dark/light mode support, professional medical green color palette.
-   **Chat Interface**: Modern layout inspired by popular chat applications, featuring multimodal input (file upload, camera, gallery, microphone with transcription).
-   **Medical Tools Modal**: Refined layout with tabs and fade-in animations for a seamless user experience.
-   **Sidebar Organization**: Intuitive navigation with main menu items, expandable search, and collapsible sections for patient management and history.
-   **TopControls Component**: Reusable tabbed interface for the medical consultation workflow, offering "ClÃ­nico" (clinical mode), "ExplicaÃ§Ã£o + EvidÃªncias" (explanatory mode), and navigation to advanced tools.
-   **AdvancedHub**: Central hub (`/avancado`) for clinical calculators and advanced features, presented in a responsive grid layout.
-   **Medical Calculators**: Interactive forms for various clinical assessments (e.g., Wells Score, Arterial/Venous Blood Gas Analysis, Gestational Age), providing real-time calculations, interpretations, and copy/clear functions.

**Technical Implementations:**
-   **Frontend**: React, TanStack Query for state management.
-   **Backend**: Node.js with Express.
-   **AI - Sistema HÃ­brido GPT-5**:
    -   **Primary Model**: GPT-5 with refined medical prompts (temperature 0.4, max 900 tokens for objective responses)
    -   **New API Integration**: Uses `client.responses.create()` and `client.responses.stream()` (latest OpenAI SDK)
    -   **Automatic Fallback Chain**: GPT-5 â†’ GPT-4o (new API) â†’ GPT-4o (legacy API) for maximum reliability
    -   **Medical Scope Detection**: Automatic validation that queries are medical-related
    -   **Refined Prompts**: Specialist system prompts (`server/medicohelp-gpt5.ts`) that respect medical terminology (CAIXA ALTA, abbreviations like BEG, LOTE, MV+)
    -   **Structured Responses**: Mode-specific formatting (ClÃ­nico: ðŸ©ºâš¡ðŸ§ªðŸ’¬ðŸ“‡, Explicativo: ðŸ‘‰ðŸ“šâš¡ðŸ’¡)
    -   **Real-time Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) with chunk-by-chunk delivery via `event.type === 'response.output_text.delta'`
-   **AI Tone**: Hybrid communication style combining informal personalized greeting with formal technical content. Starts with casual greeting using physician's first name (e.g., "Beleza, JoÃ£o. Vamos direto ao ponto:"), followed by formal technical communication with precise medical terminology (CID-10/11, SNOMED-CT, MeSH), evidence-based medicine (SBC, ESC, AHA, ACC, AMB, CFM), and professional language compatible with specialist-to-specialist communication.
-   **Configuration System**: JSON-based configuration (`config/medicohelp.clinico.v1.json`) defines AI clinical response structure with 5 mandatory sections and guardrails to prevent AI from inventing data and to ensure it requests missing critical information. It enforces 5 "Leis do MÃ©dicoHelp" for response quality.
-   **Clinical Score Detector**: Semantic detection system (`server/clinical-detector.ts`) for instantly identifying and responding to queries about clinical scales/scores without involving the main AI.
-   **Intent Detection System (Motor Ãšnico)**: An expanded system (`server/intent-detector.ts`) to detect 7 types of medical intents, using keyword, context, and priority weighting for structured responses.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
-   **Authentication**: JWT for role-based access, Email/Password, OAuth (Google, Apple, Microsoft, GitHub), and 6-digit verification codes.
-   **Storage**: DbStorage (PostgreSQL), Multer for file uploads.
-   **Validation**: Zod for data schema validation.
-   **Security**: Rate limiting using `express-rate-limit`.

**Feature Specifications:**
-   **AI Medical Chat with Dual-Mode System (GPT-5 Powered)**:
    -   **Modo ClÃ­nico (DEFAULT)**: Direct clinical decision support with structured format (ðŸ©º DiagnÃ³stico provÃ¡vel, âš¡ Conduta imediata with doses, ðŸ§ª InvestigaÃ§Ã£o complementar, ðŸ’¬ Sinais de alarme, ðŸ“‡ CID). Temperature 0.4 for stable responses. Requests missing vital signs instead of inventing data.
    -   **Modo AvanÃ§ado (Explicativo + EvidÃªncias)**: Didactic explanations with evidence-based references (ðŸ‘‰ Conceito/Fisiopatologia, ðŸ“š EvidÃªncias clÃ­nicas citing AHA/ACC/IDSA/OMS/SBC/AMB/CFM, âš¡ AplicaÃ§Ã£o prÃ¡tica, ðŸ’¡ Pontos-chave). Integrates PubMed search results when available.
    -   **Medical Scope Validation**: Automatically detects and rejects non-medical queries ("O MÃ©dicoHelp responde apenas sobre medicina").
    -   **Term Preservation**: Respects physician's original terminology (maintains CAIXA ALTA, abbreviations like BEG/LOTE/MV+, colloquial terms like "GRIPE" without converting to "sÃ­ndrome gripal").
    -   **Personalized Greeting System**: Every AI response starts with informal greeting using physician's first name (e.g., "Beleza, JoÃ£o. Vamos direto ao ponto:"), followed by formal technical content. Name automatically extracted from authenticated user data.
    -   **Hybrid Model System**: GPT-5 as primary engine with automatic fallback to GPT-4o if unavailable. Model used is logged for transparency.
    -   **Session Management**: Auto-save with intelligent titles generated from last physician message, opens new consultations in separate tabs with URL params (`?sid=xxx`).
    -   Automatic mode switching based on user input, with user-controlled toggles.
-   **MedPrime - Ferramentas MÃ©dicas AvanÃ§adas**:
    -   Professional visual card with emerald gradient design highlighting advanced medical tools.
    -   Dedicated page at `/medprime` with direct access to medical calculators.
    -   Highlighted green link in sidebar with HeartPulse icon.
    -   Features: Clinical calculators, validated scores (Wells, CURB-65, CHAâ‚‚DSâ‚‚-VASc), standardized protocols, integrated AI diagnostic support.
    -   Smooth scroll-to-section navigation within page.
-   **HistÃ³rico de Atendimentos**: Manages multiple medical consultations, saved in localStorage, with sidebar navigation, search functionality, smart titling, and optional patient association. Includes a retention policy for consultations.
-   **Exam Analysis**: Multi-file upload for automatic analysis and contextual medical interpretation.
-   **Patient Management**: CRUD operations for patient data, integrated with Memed.
-   **Clinical Evidence**: Provides scientific literature from PubMed, integrated into Explanatory Mode.
-   **Medical Professional Tools**:
    -   **Calculadoras ClÃ­nicas**: 16 medical calculators with dynamic forms, severity-colored interpretation, and calculation history. Includes advanced features like comprehensive blood gas analysis.
    -   **Partograma**: Interactive visualization of labor progression with alert/action lines, attention system, and multi-format export.

**System Design Choices:**
-   **Data Structures (PostgreSQL + Drizzle):** Tables for `patients`, `users`, `user_settings`, `consultations`, `research_analytics`, and `medical_tools_audit`.
-   **localStorage Data Structures:** Keys for `mh_atendimentos` (consultation array), `mh_current_atendimento_id`, `mh_showPatientMgmt`, `medicohelp_mode`, `medicohelp_evidence`, and `calc_history`.
